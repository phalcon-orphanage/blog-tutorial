Tutorial: your first encounter with Phalcon
===========================================

We are going to walk through a process of creating a simple web application â€“ blog.

Blog is often used as an introductory example, and there is a very good reason for that: it contains Create, Read, Update and Delete operations (CRUD for short), uses SQL database (NoSQL proponents move along please) as persistent storage - all of which are the basic building blocks of a web app.

In summary do not despair about yet another blog tutorial, it's a great showcase for any framework, and since the concepts involved in a blog are so well known, it's easy to follow
